        <p>When you think of bookkeeping, you may think it’s all just numbers and spreadsheets. That’s not exactly the case. Bookkeeping is the meticulous art of recording all financial transactions a business makes. By doing so, you can set your business up for success and have an accurate view of how it’s performing. <br><br>
        So, what is bookkeeping? And what are the benefits? Let us walk you through everything you need to know about the basics of bookkeeping.</p>

        <h2>What is Bookkeeping?</h2>
        <p>Bookkeeping is the process of tracking and recording a business’s financial transactions. These business activities are recorded based on the company’s accounting principles and supporting documentation.<br><br>
        Examples of these documents include:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Bills</li>
            <li>Receipts</li>
            <li>Invoices</li>
            <li>Purchase orders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <P>Business transactions can be recorded by hand in a journal or an Excel spreadsheet. To make things easier, many companies opt to use bookkeeping software to keep track of their financial history.<br><br>

        Bookkeeping is just one facet of doing business and keeping accurate financial records. With well-managed bookkeeping, your business can closely monitor its financial capabilities and journey toward heightened profits, breakthrough growth, and deserved success.</P>
